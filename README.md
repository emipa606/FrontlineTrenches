This portion is the known trenches mod, including:

-Two types of trenches. (provides 80 % cover. Very vulnerable to explosions)
- A ladder for leaving your trench faster. (provides 60 % cover)
- A "Step", so your people can "reach" nearby machine guns. (not needed, just for optics. Build your machinegun with the interaction-cell FIRST!  -  provides 60 % cover)
- A new type of sandbags (only need cloth for construction instead of steel, but only provides 50 % cover)
- Razorwire for defence (deals no dmg but slows down your enemy)
- Floorings: Trench Tiles, Trench Dirt and "No man's land" (slows down people by 28 %) 

- 3 new machine guns ( MG 08/15, MG 34, MG 42), with or without sandbags. Now Ammo needed
- A mid range mortar (needs ammo). Fires rapidly, but has a small detonation radius.
- A Howitzer (needs ammo). Deals more damage and can reach every point.
- An Anti-Tank gun (PAK, needs ammo). Deals immense damage (No detonation! It's just AP-Ammunition), but takes long to aim and reload. Added in to have a powerful defence against Centipede.
- A "Scherenfernrohr" - special optics to improve the accuracy of your Howitzer and AT-Gun.

New and updated sounds (explosions, incoming missles, mg-fire), mostly extracted from actual wartime recordings.
This mod should be safe for existing save-files.
